# Analyzing Electric Vehicles Population in Washington State
This project analyzes the population of electric vehicles in Washington State, focusing on attributes such as make, model, electric vehicle type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, electric range, county, and location. After cleaning the dataset and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns, a Decision Tree classifier is applied. To address class imbalance in the training data, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used.

# Data Source
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).
